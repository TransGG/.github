#### Do you have a minecraft server?
Why yes, what a convenient question, we *do* have a minecraft server. Unfortunately, in order to put our members through verification, you need to [join our Discord](https://discord.gg/transplace) in order to get access to the minecraft server. However that also means you'll get access to a friendly and supportive community chat too! See you there.
